Generic single-database configuration.

Schema notes (pending Alembic migration):
- carts.customer_id made nullable to allow guest carts (signed guest_cart_id cookie).
- carts: add promo_id, membership_id, subtotal_cents, tax_cents, fee_cents, discount_cents, total_cents.
- cart_items: add name_snapshot, base_price_cents for item snapshots.
